ONLY EDIT THE VALUES AFTER THE COLONS! IF YOU MESSED UP THE FILE, JUST DELETE IT.

--- EXTRACTING FRAMES ---
- Extract every Nth frame: 20
1 means extract every single frame. Frames will be extracted as .png images.

- Use a mask: false
On a clean run, a black .png will be generated with the dimensions of the FIRST video. (If you have different resolutions, use the option below.)
After generating this, the program will terminate. Before starting it again, you can draw white shapes on the mask files, which will be blanked out on the frames.
With this, you can hide webcams on your videos, for example.
Acceptable: "true", "false"

- Use unique mask for each video: false
This option will generate an individual mask for each video file next to it.
Acceptable: "true", "false"


--- MARKING USEFUL SLIDES ---
- Percentage treshold for new slide: 0.3
Ranges 0-100. Can be any fraction. 100 means all pixels are different.
Recommended values:
0.3 for clean videos
0.6-1.5 for noisy or badly compressed videos.

- Intro transition length in frames: 0
Counts actually extracted frames, take your setting value at "extract every Nth frame" into account!

- Transition length between slides in frames: 1
As the script goes trough the extracted frames, if it finds a difference beyond the treshold, it will jump ahead by this amount, mark that frame as a useful slide, and continue checking from there.
Counts actually extracted frames, take your setting value at "extract every Nth frame" into account!


--- EXPORTING TO PDF ---
- JPG quality of slides: 60
.png frames get converted to .jpg before getting added to the exported .pdf files. Set the quality in percentages here. 100 is lossless (but bigger).""";
